There are just over ten million children under the age of 18 living in Italy. many of those children have been effected by the earth quakes damaging various areas throughout Italy. Those specific areas have Italian children suffering from a greater level of inequality in terms of health, education and material well-being. The Italian government has introduced a number of targeted policies to help those children. However, it is difficult for families to easily access the benefit of those polices. The Terrigno Foundation expands on governmental policies and directly targets specific families and children to ensure the maximum direct contribution. The Terrigno Foundation has responded to the needs of children and families in Italy for many years, adapting its work in order to support children at risk.&lt;br>&lt;br>Michael  Terrigno
